  <p> <b>The University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as
    early as 1971, using ALOHAnet.[citation needed] Friedhelm Hillebrand
    conceptualised SMS in 1984 while working for Deutsche Telekom.
    Sitting at a typewriter at home, Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every
    letter, number, punctuation mark, and space. Almost every time,
    the messages contained fewer than 160 characters, thus giving the
    basis for the limit one could type via text messaging.[8] With Bernard
    Ghillebaert of France Télécom, he developed a proposal for the GSM
    (Groupe Spécial Mobile) meeting in February 1985 in Oslo.[9]
    The first technical solution evolved in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby.
    It was further developed under the leadership of Kevin Holley and Ian Harris (see Short Message Service).[10]
    SMS forms an integral part of Signalling System No. 7 (SS7).[11] Under SS7, it is a "state" with 160
    characters of data, coded in the ITU-T "T.56" text format,
    that has a "sequence lead in" to determine different language codes and may have special
    character codes that permit, for example, sending simple graphs as text. This was part of I
    SDN (Integrated Services Digital Network),
    and since GSM is based on this, it made its way to the mobile phone.</b>
